# Module 1 Challenge Assignment

## Description

This assignment takes the original codebase for Horiseon's website and updates it to reflect accessibility standards. This ultimately improves the website's SEO (search engine optimization). This was accomplished by adding semantic HTML elements, adding alt attributes to image elements, adding the company name to the title element, and organizing/consolidating the css.

## Usage

Below is a link to the deployed website and accompanying screenshots.
